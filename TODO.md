# Extending the Project

posible upgrade ideas:

1. Add sorting and filtering options to the browse command
1. Add pagination to the browse command
1. Add concurrency to the agg command so that it can fetch more frequently
1. Add a search command that allows for fuzzy searching of posts
1. Add bookmarking or liking posts
1. Add a TUI that allows you to select a post in the terminal and view it in a more readable format (either in the terminal or open in a browser)
1. Add an HTTP API (and authentication/authorization) that allows other users to interact with the service remotely
1. Write a service manager that keeps the agg command running in the background and restarts it if it crashes>
